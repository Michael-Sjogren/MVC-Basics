        <p>
            I am currently studying at Lexicon with focus on .NET and C#. I have interest in game development and i sometimes join game jams.
            I have a affinity for the Godot Engine since it is open source and Free with no royalites and works great on Linux.
        </p>
        <p>With that said i do also think that Unreal and Unity are great tools as well and i have used them several times.</p>
